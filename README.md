# Fake-News-Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to detect and classify news articles as fake or real using supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system processes raw textual data, transforms it into numerical representations, and applies multiple classification models to evaluate performance across different algorithmic approaches.

The project is implemented as a single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and is designed to be reproducible, modular, and extensible for future research in misinformation detection and automated content moderation.

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To build an end-to-end fake news detection pipeline
* To compare traditional machine learning models against transformer-based deep learning models
* To evaluate model robustness, accuracy, and generalization capability
* To provide a foundation for future real-time misinformation detection systems
